<h2>Prologue: The Sad State of Javascript SHA1 implementations</h2>

<p>When we started experimenting with alternative upload technologies at <a href="http://doctape.com">doctape</a> that required creating SHA1 hashes of the data locally on the client, it quickly became obvious that there were no performant pure-js implementations of SHA1 that worked correctly on binary data.</p>

<p>Jeff Mott's <a href="http://code.google.com/p/crypto-js/">CryptoJS</a> and Brian Turek's <a href="http://caligatio.github.com/jsSHA/">jsSHA</a> were both hash functions that worked correctly on ASCII strings of a small size, but didn't scale to large data and/or didn't work correctly with binary data.</p>

<p>(On a sidenode, as of now Tim Caswell's <a href="http://github.com/openpeer/cifre">Cifre</a> actually works with large binary data, as opposed to previously statet.)</p>

<p>By modifying Paul Johnston's <a href="http://pajhome.org.uk/crypt/md5/sha1.html">sha1.js</a> slightly, it worked correctly on binary data but was unfortunately very slow, especially on V8. So a few days were invested on my side to implement a Johnston-inspired SHA1 hashing function with a heavy focus on performance.</p>

<p>The result of this process is Rusha, a SHA1 hash function that works flawlessly on large amounts binary data, such as binary strings or ArrayBuffers returned by the HTML5 File API, and leverages the soon-to-be-landed-in-firefox <a href="http://asmjs.org/spec/latest/">asm.js</a> with whose support its within <em>half of native speed</em>!</p>

<h2>Installing</h2>

<h3>Node.JS</h3>

<p>There is really no point in doing this, since Node.JS already has a wonderful <code>crypto</code> module that is leveraging low-level hardware instructions to perform really nice. Your can see the comparison below in the benchmarks.</p>

<p>Rusha is available on <a href="http://npmjs.org/">npm</a> via <code>npm install rusha</code>.</p>

<p>If you still want to do this, anyhow, just <code>require()</code> the <code>rusha.js</code> file, follow the instructions on <em>Using the Rusha Object</em>.</p>

<h3>Browser</h3>

<p>Rusha is available on <a href="http://twitter.github.com/bower/">bower</a> via <code>bower install rusha</code>.</p>

<p>It is highly recommended to run CPU-intensive tasks in a <a href="http://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/DOM/Using_web_workers">Web Worker</a>. To do so, just start a worker with <code>var worker = new Worker('rusha.js')</code> and start sending it jobs. Follow the instructions on <em>Using the Rusha Worker</em>.</p>

<p>If you can't, for any reason, use Web Workers, include the <code>rusha.js</code> file in a <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> tag and follow the instructions on <em>Using the Rusha Object</em>.</p>

<h2>Using the Rusha Object</h2>

<p>Your instantiate a new Rusha object by doing <code>var r = new Rusha(optionalSizeHint)</code>. When created, it provides the following methods:</p>

<ul>
<li>
<code>Rusha#digest(d)</code>: Create a hex digest from data of the three kinds mentioned below, or throw and error if the type is unsupported.</li>
<li>
<code>Rusha#digestFromString(s)</code>: Create a hex digest from a binary <code>String</code>. A binary string is expected to only contain characters whose charCode &lt; 256.</li>
<li>
<code>Rusha#digestFromBuffer(b)</code>: Create a hex digest from a <code>Buffer</code> or <code>Array</code>. Both are expected to only contain elements &lt; 256.</li>
<li>
<code>Rusha#digestFromArrayBuffer(a)</code>: Create a hex digest from an <code>ArrayBuffer</code> object.</li>
</ul><h2>Using the Rusha Worker</h2>

<p>You can send your instance of the web worker messages in the format <code>{id: jobid, data: dataobject}</code>. The worker then sends back a message in the format <code>{id: jobid, hash: hash}</code>, were jobid is the id of the job previously received and hash is the hash of the data-object you passed, be it a <code>Blob</code>, <code>Array</code>, <code>Buffer</code>, <code>ArrayBuffer</code> or <code>String</code>.</p>

<h2>Benchmarks</h2>

<p>Tested were my Rusha implementation, the sha1.js implementation by <a href="http://pajhome.org.uk/crypt/md5/sha1.html">P. A. Johnston</a>, Tim Caswell's <a href="http://github.com/openpeer/cifre">Cifre</a> and the Node.JS native implementation.</p>

<p>If you want to check the performance for yourself in your own browser, I compiled a <a href="http://jsperf.com/rusha/2">JSPerf Page</a>.</p>

<p>A normalized estimation based on the best results for each implementation, smaller is better:

<p>All tests were performed on a MacBook Air 1.7 GHz Intel Core i5 and 4 GB 1333 MHz DDR3.</p>
